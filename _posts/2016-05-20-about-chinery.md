  There is an iPhone app called "Tube Exits" that tells you where to get on the
  London Underground to be closest to the exit when you get off. A friend
  described this as "the most Chinery thing ever".Since finishing my PhD in 2015
  I have worked as a Teaching Fellow at the University of Bath. It is a real
  test to stand in front of a class and deliver material at final year
  undergraduate and postgraduate level. My areas of expertise are visual
  computing (graphics, vision) and machine learning.I am currently looking to
  move into a position where I can apply my academic skills to more real world
  problems. As well as being an excellent developer, I can tackle complicated
  subjects from the cutting edge of research and make them accessible to
  others.But I have many passions. I will always be a computer scientist â€“ I
  love technology, efficiency, and creativity. I also love music and I have a
  penchant for a bit of opera singing that I would love to take further. When
  I'm not doing those, I'm probably trying to make myself an espresso in the
  kitchen; a completely different style of challenge. Hopefully other sections
  of this website will dive into If you came here looking for something and you
  think I might be able to help, then I would love to hear from you.
