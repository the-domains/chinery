# About Chinery

There is an iPhone app called "Tube Exits" that tells you where to get on the London Underground to be closest to the exit when you get off. A friend described this as "the most Chinery thing ever".

Since finishing my PhD in 2015 I have worked as a Teaching Fellow at the University of Bath. It is a real test to stand in front of a class and deliver material at final year undergraduate and postgraduate level. My areas of expertise are visual computing (graphics, vision) and machine learning.

I am currently looking to move into a position where I can apply my academic skills to more real world problems. As well as being an excellent developer, I can tackle complicated subjects from the cutting edge of research and make them accessible to others.

But I have many passions. I will always be a computer scientist -- I love technology, efficiency, and creativity. I also love music and I have a penchant for a bit of opera singing that I would love to take further. When I'm not doing those, I'm probably trying to make myself an espresso in the kitchen; a completely different style of challenge. Other sections of this website should have more information about my interests if you want to find out more.

If you came here looking for something and you think I might be able to help, then I would love to hear from you.
