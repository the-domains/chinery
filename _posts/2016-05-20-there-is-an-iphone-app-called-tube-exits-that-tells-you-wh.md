# About Chinery

There is an iPhone app called "Tube Exits" that tells you where to get on the London Underground to be closest to the exit when you get off. A friend described this as "the most Chinery thing ever".

I finished my PhD in 2015 and I am currently a Teaching Fellow at the University of Bath. Sitting in my first ever lectures in 2006, I wondered what it would be like to teach them, and now I am finding out!

But I have many passions. I will always be a computer scientist -- I love technology, efficiency, and creativity. I also love music and I have a penchant for a bit of opera singing that I want to take as far as I can. When I'm not doing those, I'm probably trying to make myself an espresso in the kitchen; something which is nigh impossible to do well on a normal person budget and I would not recommend! If I've done this right there might even be other pages on here for you to explore my pursuits, so have a click around!

If you came here looking for something and you think I might be able to help, then I would love to hear from you. Stay tuned for future developments. I don't know what they will be yet, but it will be exciting finding out!
